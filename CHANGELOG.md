My collegue and I created a sipmple implementation of a GraphQL Client for Flutter. (Many thanks to Eus Dima, for his work on the innitial client.)

- A client to connect to your GraphQL server.
- A query widget to handle GraphQL queries.
- A mutation widget to handle GraphQL mutations.
- Simple support for query polling.
